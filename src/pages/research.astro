        <p> Remittances account for a significant fraction of the capital flows for many developing nations.
        We develop a quantitative spatial model that jointly accounts for migration and remittances
        flows for 172 countries. Remittances are a quantitatively important force for migration decisions
        and we estimate that migrating to remit accounts for 24.3% of overall migration flows. We
        estimate that moving to a regime with costless remittance flows would increase migration by
        25.7% and the GDP of the largest beneficiaries by 16.1%. </p>
